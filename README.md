# Project
This project grew out of an effort to use an extremely light weight Microsoft excel based Point of Sale System for performing a variety of sales transactions typically done in a brick and mortar store and then load the transaction information produced by this system in the form of csv files to a MySQL database and use the power of SQL to generate different kind of Sales and Inventory reports, that can be then used to manage an ecosystem of participating stores which use this Point of Sale System.


# Software Assumptions
1. Python 2.7.9
2. Windows OS to run the Batch Scripts
3. MySQL client for Windows. 

Note that these scripts have been tested going against both a MySQL Amazon RDS instance and a locally installed MySQL Server 5.6.
